# Titanic_Survival_prediction
We'll use cross validation and a hyperparameter grid search to optimize machine learning pipeline. We will use the Titanic Survival Dataset to build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on attributes of each passenger in the data set.
